# Operation-Research

Operations Research Course Project

This project was completed as part of operations research I course. 
It involved developing a mathematical model to optimize the allocation of repair equipment across multiple repair and collection centers. The model minimizes total costs including transportation, installation, and operational costs subject to equipment capacity and demand constraints.

- Designing and formulating mathematical models representing real-world system 
- Linearizing nonlinear model
- Implementing models in Lingo optimization software
- Interpreting and analyzing optimization results
- Conducting sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in parameters impact the optimal solution
- Effectively communicating mathematical analysis and results through written reports and visual plots
